# Interpret

All these codes are wrote to implement function of real time interpret system on mobile messanger.

# Using API
1. NAVER PAPAGO OPEN API
2. KAKAO OPEN REST API and SDK

# Simple Structure of APP
1. Input message with web page that I made
2. Bring those message to controller that configured with JAVA type PAPAGO API 
3. Convey output of controller to JSON Parser object class
4. Print interpreted result message to KAKAO friends Chat Room

01. We may need chat bot API to implement function of entering uninterpreted message and printing interpreted message.
02. I'm gonna consider using another API depending on progress of this project.

# init_commit

I did test to check meaning of REST API and PAPAGO API cause it is my first time with using APIs from NAVER, KAKAO.
